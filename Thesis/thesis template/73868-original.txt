A MYSTERIOUS CHURCH MOVING
Swedish congregation s Altar held in
Paws by the Church of the Redeemer
Sixteen men and a heavy truck Made a call at
the Sunday school building connected with the
Church of the Redeemer in Astoria shortly
after sundown last night The truck was backed
up to the curb and the sixteen men became
active
Two of them were stationed as sentries up and
down Temple street and another led the way to
the front door of the building and unlocked the
door
Entering the Sunday school the fourteen
seized the altar the organ church books and a
quantity of Sunday school paraphernalia This
was piled on the truck the sentries were Called
in and in less than ten minutes the truck and
its load had disappeared
It is supposed that the sixteen mysterious vis
itors were the representatives of a small Swed
ish congregation that had been Worshipping for
some time in the Sunday school building The
goods taken away were the property of this con
gregation
About two years ago when it organized it ap
Plied to the wardens of the Church of the Re
deemer for permission to use the Sunday school
building The wardens consented and fixed a
price for the use of the building sufficient to
cover the expense of fuel and light
After the new congregation had used the little
building for sixteen months the wardens asked
for the rent The Swedes pleaded poverty and
asked tor time They ceased to worship in the
Sunday school building and began holding
services in a little hall in another part of the
city Then they applied to the Church of the
Redeemer for the organ and other articles be
longing to them
This request was denied and the denial was
accompanied with a hint that it might be the
proper thing to pay what they owed before they
took away their belongings
The Sunday school was then locked and the
little body of Swedes was forbidden to enter it
