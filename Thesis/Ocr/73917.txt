PAID 11EH FARE JV BIAXPS
One IToman Who Certainly Did Not Intend
to Heat Her Way
A woman who got on a Lee and Nottrand av
enne car In Wllllnmtburgh yesterday afternoon
to BO shopping discovered when the conductor
came for his fare that she had nothing less than
U and S10 notes
1 cant change any of those bills said the
conductor who looked very disgusted Prs
rung you up now and If yon get off Ill be outs
nickel anyhow You may as well stay and
maybe oull remember the five cents you owe
when you see me again
The woman looked through her pocketbook
and came across some twocent postage stamps
Him called the conductor and handed him three
of them The conductor offered her a penny
In change but she refused to accept It
If every woman was like hersaid the con
ductor lo a SUM reporter wo wouldnt bo out
ns much money ns we sometimes arc There Is
n clams of women who get on time cars and pur
posely have nothing less than a big bill The
know that the conductor cant thanite It nnrt
that they get n free ride Whats the use of
putting them off after the fare has been rung
up Were out the nickel Thats the first time
I ever Rot postage stamps for fare That woman
Is honest anyway
