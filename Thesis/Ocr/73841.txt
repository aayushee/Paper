A great many application for relict have re
cently been made to the Jewish charitable sod
etlca by those of the east aide cloakmakcrs who
are yet out on strike A short time mo several
of these societies Rare notice that they would
not contribute to the support of any hotly of
strikers who had It In their power to obtain work
and wnites and this policy hi been maintained
by them since the rioting of the dirty little place
In Ludlow street at which free bread and alt
herrings were occasionally distributed In small
quantities to the hungry men on strike An
agent of one of the Jewish charity societies said
yesterday that art of the funds of hit society
coma from some of the cloak manufacturers
against whom the strikers hare been standing
out for the past three months or more and that
It could not bo expected that this money of the
employers would be used to support the wage
workers who are making war upon them t for
thus said he the manufacturers by furnish
Ing the sinews of war to the enemy would be re
sponslhle for their own defeat If the Jewish
worken ho contlnurd could strike at any
time with the assurance of being supported out
of the treasuries of the Jewish charity societies
all the Industries at which the Itusstan Immi
grants find employment would bo brought to a
standstill To one Ilroadwny cloak firm we are
Indebted for an annual contribution which Is a
mainstay of our society and when this firms
operatives demanded higher pay we could not
hand them out the fund which their employer
had Intrusted to our care and he himself notlned
us that If we thus disbursed any part of our
fund he would withdraw his support from our
society Within the past few years nearly all the
clothing Unties lime fallen Into the hands of
Jcwl b capitalists who have found their most
useful workers among the tens of thousands of
Itusslan Immigrants who have come to this
country and It has been found necessary to give
these Immigrants lessons upon the way In bleu
the Industry must bo conducted no ns to make
It advantageous to the manufacturers who In
vest their capital In It Our society will not
give supplies to any of the strikers who make
complaint They themselves must be held re
sponsible for their own sufferings
This Is the charity agents side of the ciso
The talkers on the strikers side of It say that
they would not need charity If they got living
wages that their unions have often helped to
support the charity societies and that their
rich emplojers ought to aid In rescuing the
children of the tihetto from the degraded
condition In which they live In Now York to
this disgrace of their rare and faith They re
cite passages from the Torah to show how the
lawacf Moses might bo used for their advantage
In this age of the world even In a country which
Is under the power of Christianity It must be
remembered that the great mass of the Jewish
residents of the east side belong to the most
orthodox school of Judaism and that the un
believers Anarchist constitute an Inconsid
erable proportion of them
As far bock as October last the Jewish Mtrten
qer of this city gave advice which has been
Justlllcd by experience to the strikers who are
now making complaint It warned them In
plain words that the Jewish organized charities
would not support them while they were out on
strike Since the Ludlow street free bread
depot which wa opened at Irregular periods
within the past three months has been closed
the pressure upon the treasury of some of the
Jewish charities has been heavy It has been
found Impossible In some cases to resist thin
appeals for relief but a number of applicants
who have had experience with the charity
agents say that It was Impossible for them to
give satisfactory ansn era to the questions which
were addressed to them They have had to con
fess despite nil attempts at evasion and all the
dories by which they sought to create pity thai
they are or have been on strike THE HUN re
porter learned however that In some Instances
the Jewish Sisterhoods of 1ersonal bervlce
have brought relief to families which had
reached the last extremity
